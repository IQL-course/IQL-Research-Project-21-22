### Repository organization
The repository contains the following folders:
 * _code_: all the R and Python code developed to preprocess and analyze the data (running R code requires being located in this folder)
 * _data_: Common Voice Forced Alignments and Parallel Universal Dependencies datasets, both filtered (_filtered_ subfolder) and not filtered (_non\_filtered_ subfolder)  as described in the paper
 * _figures_: figures produced for the paper, both using the filtered data (_filtered_ subfolder) and the non-filtered data (_non\_filtered_ subfolder)
 * _latex\_tables_: latex tables produced for the paper, both using the filtered data (_filtered_ subfolder) and the non-filtered data (_non\_filtered_ subfolder)
 * _results_: csv files obtained from the analysis, both using the filtered data (_filtered_ subfolder) and the non-filtered data (_non\_filtered_ subfolder)

Throughout the whole repository _pud_ stands for the Parallel Universal Dependencies collection and _cv_ stands for the Common Voice Forced Alignments collection.
